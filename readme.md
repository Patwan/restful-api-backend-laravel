# RESTFUL API backend using Laravel

A project showing how to create a RESTFUL API backend using Laravel PHP framework. Basically this API endpoint can be used with any front-end web framework such as Angular, React or Vuejs. It can also be used by Mobile frameworks. In this repo, we create Single Page Applications using Angular and Vuejs which reach out to this API backend.

## Authentication
